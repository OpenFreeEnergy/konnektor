**Changed:**

* For both ``ExplicitNetworkGenerator.generate_network_from_indices()`` and ``ExplicitNetworkGenerator.generate_network_from_names()``, all ``components`` will be included as nodes in the network. If this results in a disconnected network (in the case where one or more of the ``components`` is not included in ``indices``, or ``names``, respectively), a warning will be raised.
