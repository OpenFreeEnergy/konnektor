**Changed:**

* If multiple mappers are passed to a network planner, but no scorer, the *first* mappping from the *first* mapper provided will be used. This is a change from the previous behavior, which would use the *first* mapping from the *last* mapper. The current behavior is now consistent with ``openfe``\'s network planning behavior.
