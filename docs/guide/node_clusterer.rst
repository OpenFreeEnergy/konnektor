Node Clusterer
==============================================================
To separate a collection of Components by a specific property, the
`Clusterer` classes can be utilized. They serve as powerful tools within
a workflow and are, for example, part of the Starry Sky Network.

In Konnektor, the following clustering classes are currently available:

* `ChargeClusterer` – separates molecules by net charge changes
* `ScaffoldClusterer` – separates molecules by shared scaffolds
* `DiversityClusterer` – uses fingerprints to cluster the different molecules.
