Edge Intermediate Generator
==============================================================

To overcome large molecular differences, it can be helpful to create an
intermediate state between two molecules. Classes that perform this task
are called Intermediator in Konnektor. You can provide them with two
`Component`s, and they will attempt to construct intermediate states
between the two `Component`s.
